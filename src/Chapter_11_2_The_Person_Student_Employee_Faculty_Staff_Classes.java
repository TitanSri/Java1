/*********************************************************************************
* (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a           *
* class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.          *
* Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,            *
* address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status         *
* (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An  *
* employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined   *
* in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty    *
* member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the   *
* toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name. *
* Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program  *
* that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes      *
* their toString() methods.                                                      *
